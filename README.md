This repo is just a baseline for using our apis

# 1 - on project folder

npm install

WARNING: if needed, use --force
this happens because not all dependencies are up-to-date

#2 - on your controller (spring boot)

@CrossOrigin("\*")                       
/\* This will free all entries to the application: !!!!!NEVER USE IT IN PRODUCTION!!!!!    \*/

public class PostController {
...
}


# 3 - on your react folder

npm start
